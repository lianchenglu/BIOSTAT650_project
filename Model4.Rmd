#From the plot above, there is 7 observations(1048,1769,1684, 74, 72, 1689, 1311) located in the intersection areas of both outlier and leverage, which is to say, those observations has both the leverage and the externally studentized residual exceeding their respective thresholds.Due to its large DIFFITS and Cook's D, they are potentially influential observations.
#The thresholds for the externally studentized residual are -2 and 2, i.e. 2 in magnitude. The thresholds for the leverage of the R default is 0.011

#From (DFFITS), observations 879 and 1769 appear to be influential observations. Observation 1155 has extraordinarily large leverage. Therefore, I choose to remove these 14 observations in the re-fitted mode

#After looking at residuals from models using the log-transformed (natural log scale) BMI adjusted for other predictors, I agree that we should use log-transformed NIHScore because there is less of a discernible pattern in the residual plots. The residuals are also a lot less skewed once we log-transform this variable. Furthermore, there are fewer observations with extreme values on the QQ plot so the normality assumption appears to hold.

#collinearity diagnostics

car::vif(m_full.log)
#The VIF from both the models are the same. None of the VIF values are greater than 10. So there are no concerns about collinearity.
