abstract = {Background
Although the consequences of sleep deficiency for obesity risk are increasingly apparent, experimental evidence is limited and there are no studies on body fat distribution.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of experimentally-induced sleep curtailment in the setting of free access to food on energy intake, energy expenditure, and regional body composition.
Methods
Twelve healthy, nonobese individuals (9 males, age range 19 to 39 years) completed a randomized, controlled, crossover, 21-day inpatient study comprising 4 days of acclimation, 14 days of experimental sleep restriction (4 hour sleep opportunity) or control sleep (9 hour sleep opportunity), and a 3-day recovery segment. Repeated measures of energy intake, energy expenditure, body weight, body composition, fat distribution and circulating biomarkers were acquired.
Results
With sleep restriction vs control, participants consumed more calories (P = 0.015), increasing protein (P = 0.050) and fat intake (P = 0.046). Energy expenditure was unchanged (all P > 0.16). Participants gained significantly more weight when exposed to experimental sleep restriction than during control sleep (P = 0.008). While changes in total body fat did not differ between conditions (P = 0.710), total abdominal fat increased only during sleep restriction (P = 0.011), with significant increases evident in both subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat depots (P = 0.047 and P = 0.042, respectively).
Conclusions
Sleep restriction combined with ad libitum food promotes excess energy intake without varying energy expenditure. Weight gain and particularly central accumulation of fat indicate that sleep loss predisposes to abdominal visceral obesity. (Sleep Restriction and Obesity; NCT01580761)}

TITLE = {The Association Between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Sleep Duration: Where Are We after nearly Two Decades of Epidemiological Research?},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past twenty years we have seen a vast number of epidemiological studies emerge on the topic of obesity and sleep duration, with a focus on body mass index, as it is easy and cheap to measure and analyse. Such studies largely observe that cross-sectionally a higher BMI is associated with shorter sleep and that in longitudinal studies shorter sleep duration is associated with increases in BMI over time, but some research has found no relationship between the two. This narrative review is not exhaustive, but appraises the literature on sleep duration and BMI from perspectives that have previously been unexplored in a single paper. As such, I discuss research in these important areas: bidirectionality, objective vs. subjective sleep duration, how meaningful the effect sizes are and how we have begun to address causality in this area. From the evidence appraised in this review, it is clear that: (i) there is some modest evidence of a bidirectional relationship between BMI and sleep duration in both children and adults; (ii) objective measurements of sleep should be used where possible; (iii) it remains difficult to confirm whether the effect sizes are conclusively meaningful in a clinical setting, but at least in adults this so far seems unlikely; (iv) to date, there is no solid evidence that this relationship (in either direction) is in fact causal. In the near future, I would like to see triangulation of these findings and perhaps a move towards focusing on distinct aspects of the relationship between obesity and sleep that have not previously been addressed in detail, for various reasons.},

abstract = {This narrative review will present and discuss clinical data from 16 cross-sectional and 6 longitudinal studies examining the relationship between body mass index (BMI), symptoms of depression and peripheral inflammation. Our aim is to determine which of obesity and depression contributes best to the peripheral low-grade inflammation frequently associated to both conditions. Studies including a complete evaluation of inflammatory markers are scarce and high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most consistent findings associated with obesity and symptoms of depression. Among the cross-sectional studies, seven studies, including a total of 9421 individuals, pointed to BMI as the major factor associated with systemic low-grade inflammation. However, in four studies, including 16,837 individuals, CRP levels remained associated with the symptoms of depression even after correction for BMI, suggestion that in the absence of overweight or obesity other sources of peripheral inflammation might contribute to presence of depressive symptoms. Additionally, another five studies, including 5569 individuals failed to find an association between depression and peripheral inflammation, reinforcing the heterogeneity of this condition. In the longitudinal data, changes in BMI were associated with a reduction in depressive scores at follow-up, after bariatric surgery or after diet. In four longitudinal studies, high levels of CRP were found to be associated with depression even after adjustment for BMI and weight loss, further corroborating the idea that other sources of peripheral inflammation might contribute to depressive symptoms. Thus it seems that both obesity and depressive symptoms can contribute to peripheral inflammation, and once installed the presence of inflammation can contribute to several behavioral alterations that reinforce the cyclic pattern of co-occurrence observed in patients with obesity and MDD. Future clinical studies should focus on strategic efforts to collect new data and to improve or standardize methods for the evaluation of depression, body composition and a more complete inflammatory profile. These approaches are essential for the development of pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological strategies designed to break this cyclic pattern of co-occurrence.}

However, it remains unclear whether the interrelationships between obesity, glutamine, and depression are causal.We conducted 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore the causalities between circulating glutamine levels, specific depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder (MDD), and body mass index (BMI).Univariable MR, multivariable MR (MVMR), and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) analyses were performed.Genetic downregulation of glutamine was causally associated with MDD, anhedonia, tiredness, and depressed mood at the false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled significance level (estimate, −0.036 ∼ −0.013; P = .005 to P = .050). Elevated BMI was causally linked to lower glutamine level (estimate, –0.103; P = .037), as well as more severe depressed mood, tiredness, and anhedonia (estimate, 0.017 ∼ 0.050; P \\&lt; .001 to P = .040). In MVMR analysis, BMI was causally related to depressed mood dependently of glutamine levels. Conversely, it showed limited evidence supporting causal effects of depression on glutamine levels or BMI, except a causal association of tiredness with elevated BMI (estimate, 0.309; P = .003). LDSR estimates were directionally consistent with MR results.The present study reported that higher BMI was causally associated with lower glutamine levels. Both obesity and downregulation of glutamine were causally linked to depression.}",

Methods: The sample population consisted of young (18-35) and middle-aged (36-55) adults living in the Balearic Islands, Spain. The data represent 1,089 people during 1999-2000 and 1,081 people during 2000-2010. Weighted-based frequency estimates were used. Results: While no differences between self-reported and measured weight, height and BMI were found in the respondents, it was seen that a decreasing percentage of the population knows their own weight and/or height. A rise in awareness was found in normal-weight men (from 95.0% to 98.9%), and also in normal-weight men and in the middle-aged obese category whose self-reported BMI was not defi ned as "correct" (from 41.2% to 85.7% and from 41.0% to 67.6% respectively). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of the population does not know their own weight or height. The obtained results suggest the need to develop strategies to enhance awareness of own weight and height.}

abstract = {The relationship between health and work is frequently investigated using self-assessments of disability from social surveys. The complication is that respondents may overstate their level of disability to justify non-employment and welfare receipt. This study provides new evidence on the existence and magnitude of justification bias by exploiting a novel feature of a large longitudinal survey: each wave respondents are asked identical disability questions twice; near the beginning and end of the face-to-face interview. Prior to answering the second disability question, respondents are asked a series of questions that increase the salience of their employment and welfare circumstances. Justification bias is identified by comparing the variation between the two measures within-individuals over time, with the variation in employment status over time. Results indicate substantial and statistically significant justification bias; especially for men and women who receive disability pensions.}

In a cross-sectional study, the investigator measures the outcome and the exposures in the study participants at the same time. Unlike in case–control studies (participants selected based on the outcome status) or cohort studies (participants selected based on the exposure status), the participants in a cross-sectional study are just selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria set for the study. Once the participants have been selected for the study, the investigator follows the study to assess the exposure and the outcomes. Cross-sectional designs are used for population-based surveys and to assess the prevalence of diseases in clinic-based samples. These studies can usually be conducted relatively faster and are inexpensive. They may be conducted either before planning a cohort study or a baseline in a cohort study. These types of designs will give us information about the prevalence of outcomes or exposures; this information will be useful for designing the cohort study. However, since this is a 1-time measurement of exposure and outcome, it is difficult to derive causal relationships from cross-sectional analysis. We can estimate the prevalence of disease in cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, we will also be able to estimate the odds ratios to study the association between exposure and the outcomes in this design.}

An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed optimization problem. Monte Carlo studies are evaluated the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the finite sample performance of the proposed methods performs better than that of the existing methods when there are leverage points or outliers in the response variable or explanatory variables.

abstract = {Regression analysis is one of the most popular statistical techniques that attempt to explore the relationships between a response (dependent) variable and one or more explanatory (independent) variables. To test the overall significance of regression, F-statistic is used if the parameters are estimated by the least-squares estimators (LSEs), while if the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs), the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic is used. However, both procedures produce misleading results and often fail to provide good fits to the reasonable space of the dataset in the presence of outlying observations. Moreover, outliers occur very frequently in any real datasets as well as in the molecular OMICS datasets. Hence, an effort is made in this study to robustify MLE based regression analysis by maximizing the β-likelihood function. The tuning parameter β is selected by cross-validation. For β = 0, the proposed method reduces to the classical MLE based regression analysis. We inspect the performance of the proposed method using both synthetic and real data analysis. The results of simulations indicate that the proposed method performs better than traditional methods in both outliers and high leverage points to estimate the parameters and mean square errors. The results of relative efficiency analysis show that the proposed estimator is relatively less affected than the popular estimators, including S, MM, and fast-S for normal error distribution in case high dimension and outliers. Also, real data analysis results demonstrated that the proposed method shows robust properties with respect to data contaminations, overcome the drawback of the traditional methods. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by the proposed method identify the vital gene influencing hypertension and iron level in the liver and spleen of mice. Furthermore, we have identified 15 and 21 significant SNPs for chalkiness degree and chalkiness percentage, respectively, by GWAS based on the proposed method. The variant of the SNPs might be provided the new resources for grain quality traits and could be used for further molecular and physiological analysis to enhance the better quality of rice grain. These results offer an important basis for further understanding of the robust regression analysis, which might be applied in various fields, including business, genetics, and bioinformatics.}

Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD)/odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for factor-disease association using either fixed (when I2 <50%) or random effect (when I2 >50%) models. Eight studies involving 1,585 MCI cases and 6,700 normal subjects were included in our meta-analysis which showed no significant association of increased cIMT with the risk of MCI [SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 2.42]. However, sensitivity analysis revealed an outlier study significantly affecting the effect size. On omitting the outlier study, the re-evaluated meta-analysis revealed a significant association of cIMT with the risk of MCI [SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78]. This significant association was also observed during subgroup analysis in Caucasian population [SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.18] but not in Asian population [SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.79]. Elevated cIMT poses a potential risk for MCI. However, more population-based studies are required to corroborate these findings.}
