abstract = {Background
Although the consequences of sleep deficiency for obesity risk are increasingly apparent, experimental evidence is limited and there are no studies on body fat distribution.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of experimentally-induced sleep curtailment in the setting of free access to food on energy intake, energy expenditure, and regional body composition.
Methods
Twelve healthy, nonobese individuals (9 males, age range 19 to 39 years) completed a randomized, controlled, crossover, 21-day inpatient study comprising 4 days of acclimation, 14 days of experimental sleep restriction (4 hour sleep opportunity) or control sleep (9 hour sleep opportunity), and a 3-day recovery segment. Repeated measures of energy intake, energy expenditure, body weight, body composition, fat distribution and circulating biomarkers were acquired.
Results
With sleep restriction vs control, participants consumed more calories (P = 0.015), increasing protein (P = 0.050) and fat intake (P = 0.046). Energy expenditure was unchanged (all P > 0.16). Participants gained significantly more weight when exposed to experimental sleep restriction than during control sleep (P = 0.008). While changes in total body fat did not differ between conditions (P = 0.710), total abdominal fat increased only during sleep restriction (P = 0.011), with significant increases evident in both subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat depots (P = 0.047 and P = 0.042, respectively).
Conclusions
Sleep restriction combined with ad libitum food promotes excess energy intake without varying energy expenditure. Weight gain and particularly central accumulation of fat indicate that sleep loss predisposes to abdominal visceral obesity. (Sleep Restriction and Obesity; NCT01580761)}

TITLE = {The Association Between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Sleep Duration: Where Are We after nearly Two Decades of Epidemiological Research?},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past twenty years we have seen a vast number of epidemiological studies emerge on the topic of obesity and sleep duration, with a focus on body mass index, as it is easy and cheap to measure and analyse. Such studies largely observe that cross-sectionally a higher BMI is associated with shorter sleep and that in longitudinal studies shorter sleep duration is associated with increases in BMI over time, but some research has found no relationship between the two. This narrative review is not exhaustive, but appraises the literature on sleep duration and BMI from perspectives that have previously been unexplored in a single paper. As such, I discuss research in these important areas: bidirectionality, objective vs. subjective sleep duration, how meaningful the effect sizes are and how we have begun to address causality in this area. From the evidence appraised in this review, it is clear that: (i) there is some modest evidence of a bidirectional relationship between BMI and sleep duration in both children and adults; (ii) objective measurements of sleep should be used where possible; (iii) it remains difficult to confirm whether the effect sizes are conclusively meaningful in a clinical setting, but at least in adults this so far seems unlikely; (iv) to date, there is no solid evidence that this relationship (in either direction) is in fact causal. In the near future, I would like to see triangulation of these findings and perhaps a move towards focusing on distinct aspects of the relationship between obesity and sleep that have not previously been addressed in detail, for various reasons.},

abstract = {This narrative review will present and discuss clinical data from 16 cross-sectional and 6 longitudinal studies examining the relationship between body mass index (BMI), symptoms of depression and peripheral inflammation. Our aim is to determine which of obesity and depression contributes best to the peripheral low-grade inflammation frequently associated to both conditions. Studies including a complete evaluation of inflammatory markers are scarce and high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most consistent findings associated with obesity and symptoms of depression. Among the cross-sectional studies, seven studies, including a total of 9421 individuals, pointed to BMI as the major factor associated with systemic low-grade inflammation. However, in four studies, including 16,837 individuals, CRP levels remained associated with the symptoms of depression even after correction for BMI, suggestion that in the absence of overweight or obesity other sources of peripheral inflammation might contribute to presence of depressive symptoms. Additionally, another five studies, including 5569 individuals failed to find an association between depression and peripheral inflammation, reinforcing the heterogeneity of this condition. In the longitudinal data, changes in BMI were associated with a reduction in depressive scores at follow-up, after bariatric surgery or after diet. In four longitudinal studies, high levels of CRP were found to be associated with depression even after adjustment for BMI and weight loss, further corroborating the idea that other sources of peripheral inflammation might contribute to depressive symptoms. Thus it seems that both obesity and depressive symptoms can contribute to peripheral inflammation, and once installed the presence of inflammation can contribute to several behavioral alterations that reinforce the cyclic pattern of co-occurrence observed in patients with obesity and MDD. Future clinical studies should focus on strategic efforts to collect new data and to improve or standardize methods for the evaluation of depression, body composition and a more complete inflammatory profile. These approaches are essential for the development of pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological strategies designed to break this cyclic pattern of co-occurrence.}

    abstract = "{Observational studies indicated obesity and glutamatergic dysfunction as potential risk factors of depression, and reported disturbance of glutamine metabolism in obese state. However, it remains unclear whether the interrelationships between obesity, glutamine, and depression are causal.We conducted 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore the causalities between circulating glutamine levels, specific depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder (MDD), and body mass index (BMI).Univariable MR, multivariable MR (MVMR), and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) analyses were performed.Genetic downregulation of glutamine was causally associated with MDD, anhedonia, tiredness, and depressed mood at the false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled significance level (estimate, −0.036 ∼ −0.013; P = .005 to P = .050). Elevated BMI was causally linked to lower glutamine level (estimate, –0.103; P = .037), as well as more severe depressed mood, tiredness, and anhedonia (estimate, 0.017 ∼ 0.050; P \\&lt; .001 to P = .040). In MVMR analysis, BMI was causally related to depressed mood dependently of glutamine levels. Conversely, it showed limited evidence supporting causal effects of depression on glutamine levels or BMI, except a causal association of tiredness with elevated BMI (estimate, 0.309; P = .003). LDSR estimates were directionally consistent with MR results.The present study reported that higher BMI was causally associated with lower glutamine levels. Both obesity and downregulation of glutamine were causally linked to depression.}",
